# 2022ScoutingApp_Pie
Crevolution Scouting APP V2.0. This one is upgraded to a newer OS (ANDROID 11 GO) and is to be utilized for LENOVO tablets. This app is dedicated to all the Crevolution team members, mentors, and alumnis, who drive the team forward!


TODO: 
This app still includes a multitude of bugs that will be fixed off season this year. 
Another possible side project is to add click based shots counting along with a heatmap for a visual aid for scouters to analyze various team data.
There is also a plan to make a side app that scans qr codes and directly transfers them to a CSV rather than the use of a Python utility.
